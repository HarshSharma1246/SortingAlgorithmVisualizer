# SortingAlgorithmVisualizer

Welcome to the Sorting Visualizer project! This is a web application designed to visualize various sorting algorithms in action. It allows you to see how different algorithms work by visually representing the sorting process using bars that represent elements to be sorted.

## Demo

Here's a live demo of the Sorting Visualizer: [Demo Link](your-demo-link)

## Features

- Visualize sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Quick Sort, and Merge Sort.
- Adjustable array size and sorting speed for customization.
- Real-time visualization of sorting process.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/HarshSharma1246/SortingAlgoritmVsualizer.git`
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## Usage

1. Choose the desired sorting algorithm from the available options.
2. Adjust the array size and sorting speed using the sliders.
3. Click the "Sort" button to visualize the selected algorithm in action.
4. Observe how the bars rearrange themselves to represent the sorting process.

## Algorithms

- **Bubble Sort**: Compare and swap adjacent elements until the array is sorted.
- **Selection Sort**: Select the smallest (or largest) element and swap it with the first unsorted element.
- **Insertion Sort**: Build a sorted array by repeatedly inserting unsorted elements.
- **Quick Sort**: Divide the array into smaller sub-arrays and recursively sort them.
- **Merge Sort**: Divide the array into halves, sort them, and then merge them.
